# Charlotte&Co
 
 This is a site where the user can input there own products which, will automatically update the Nav Menu, with categories and subcategories, alowing the user to input each unique transfer, and seel their products.
 
 A user can login, however if they are not classed as isAdmin they will not be able to edit any of the products.
 
 Before the user is logged in they will be able to veiw the products, If a user is logged on they will be able to view the products and add them into their basket.
 
 I will use a SQL dtatbase for the Basket and User information.
 
 I will be using a mongoose databse for the products and menu infromation.
 
 The user will be able to signup on our site or log in with facebook and google+ using passport.
 
 The payment will be using PayPal, to make payments.
 
 I will be using cloudinary to upload the oimages for the products and also view the images as this will also adjust the quality depending on the images that are produced to lower the trafic on the server.
 
 I will also allow the user to create their own ediatbale products if the product will allow that. This will be a page that the user types in their input and they will be able to see the image change and display thier input. The user will also be able to have the choice of all of the texts that the company can use and also the colors of the transfers that company has available.
